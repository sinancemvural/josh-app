    question: 'What is a kendama?',

    id: 'how-long-until-good',
    question: 'How long does it take to become good?',
    answer: 'The kendama is a deceptively difficult toy to become proficient with. Most of the people you see doing amazing tricks in videos have been doing it for many, many years!',

  {
    id: 'how-to-choose',
    question: 'How do I pick the right kendama for me?',
    answer: "Kendamas come in a wide array of designs, but for beginners, we recommend a plain wooden kendama. It's natural for the toy to get pretty banged up as you practice. Once you're more comfortable with the fundamentals, you can invest in a beautiful painted kendama.",
